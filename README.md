# Online Calculator
Online Calculator was developed as an example usage of latest technologies such as Angular 6 on UI side and WebApi on backend.

On UI was used Angular 6.1 with TypeScript, Twitter Bootstrap 4.1 for styling, and Angular CLI for project building.

Backend side uses WebApi2, Autofac as IoC container. Server code has unit tests for domain and web projects.

Both sides uses input data validation.

API on backend uses port 4201. Angular project uses default port 4200.
